# state/handoff.md — current-pass handoff

- **round:** Wave-A execution. AUD-05B is closed after authorized re-Review. Dashboard extraction
  and C4 Option A cleanup are committed in `7dede9b`. C1 BLS disable, C2 VIX FRED adapter and C3
  PRAW requestor wrapper are COMPLETE after Engineer evidence, independent Verifier PASS and
  independent Reviewer APPROVE, and are ready for the Group A commit. 2026-08-01.
- **outcome:** project remains an evidence-first PIT research harness, not a validated stock-picking strategy.
  Historical B/C/D/E1 are shared-fold purged CV-proxies (not chronological OOS); LLM not in headlines;
  E3 NO-GO for headline.
- **COMPLETE:** AUD-01/02/03/04/05A/05B (each Verifier PASS + Reviewer APPROVE); AUD-05C disposition
  (Reviewer APPROVE; 10 boundaries → C1-C5 + Kenneth-French task files); **AUD-07 FROZEN** via
  [ADR-010](../decisions/ADR-010-sesoi-tost-sequential-gate.md) + E3 pre-reg §7 (SESOI ±0.010 / HAC-TOST
  90% / O'Brien-Fleming 60·90·120mo / n_trials=30; 3× cross-validated; equivalence+sequential
  construction amended).
- **STATISTICAL HOLD:** AUD-07B reopens the implementation-level proof only: ADR-010's amendment says
  TOST p-values “exceed alpha”, which appears reversed, and the sequential equivalence construction
  requires strong independent review. Do not implement or expose E3 inferential verdicts meanwhile.
- **C-series prepped → owner-decidable:**
  - **C3 (PRAW 7-gate)**: OWNER APPROVED WITH CONDITIONS (all 7 gates PASS; G1 BSD-2/Apache-2.0, G2 PIT,
    G3 snapshot handles user-edits, G4 sha256+append, G5/G6 exploratory-only, G7 PRAW 1.5s+ToS).
    Conditions: Reddit ToS internal-only/no-redistribute; permanent `mode:exploratory`. Engineer,
    Verifier and Reviewer are complete; no live pull is authorized.
  - **C1 (BLS disable)**: owner-authorized disable-only implementation is complete. CPI/NFP cache
    misses fail closed before HTTP; FOMC/cache behavior is preserved. Independent Verifier PASS and
    Reviewer APPROVE are recorded; Group A commit is next.
  - **C2 (VIX/FRED)**: owner-authorized implementation replaces SDK fetches with the shared-policy
    FRED observations adapter while retaining ADR-003 PIT/cache/ledger behavior. Independent
    Verifier PASS and Reviewer APPROVE are recorded.
  - **C4 (health_check)**: standalone Option A is owner-authorized and complete in `7dede9b`.
    The blocked data/wheel probes and stale text are removed; seven hermetic tests, lint, scan and
    review pass.
  - **C5 (model-API ≥2s)**: **Option A (SDK-exempt)** recommended — model APIs throttled by provider
    RPM/TPM + ProviderRouter cooldown + idempotent cache; ≥2s redundant for GLM (RPM 30), harmful for
    SiliconFlow (RPM 1000). Rule wording drafted. → owner accept.
- **P2 legacy split → partially replan-required**: 10 prior `TASK-RES-01..10` files exist (baseline-ladder
  RES-01/02/03 [mom/FF5/rank-objective]; economic-lens RES-04/05/06/07 [next-open/turnover-slippage/
  liquidity-borrow/delisting-capacity]; LLM-eval RES-08/09/10 [gold-set/zero-LLM-ablation/eval-metrics]).
  RES-02/03/08/10 are now HOLD/REPLAN because of cross-sectional-variation, rank-label,
  durable-gold and remote-determinism defects. Do not authorize those files as written; use RD tasks first.
- **owner-decision queue (consolidated — further progress needs these):**
  - **C5**: accept Option A + record the rule wording?
  - **Kenneth-French / selection-panel FRED+Fama-French**: data-intake 7-gate decision.
  - **AUD-06**: owner contract (E3 live-input readiness acceptance points).
  - **RES program**: no legacy RES task should start before RD-17 and its listed prerequisites; RES-02/03/08/10
    specifically require rewritten specs.
  - **RD program**: launch only P0 closure, P0 + the offline RD-01..17 program, or selected RD tasks?
  - **Commit?** audit remediation is committed as `e8545d4` and dashboard/C4 remediation as
    `7dede9b` (both on remote `main`). C1/C2 await independent review before their own commit.
- **verification:** the full hermetic pytest suite currently passes (existing forward-score warnings
  only), `uv run --offline ruff check` and `git diff --check` pass, and frozen
  prereg/ADR/config/ledger/results/data/forward remain untouched. Group A C1/C2/C3 each have
  independent Verifier PASS and Reviewer APPROVE. `runs/ledger.jsonl` remains unchanged; no E3
  outcome was observed and no confirmatory/strategy/horizon/forward/real-network/LLM script ran.
- **planning artifact:** `reports/milestone/2026-08-01-low-reasoning-development-roadmap.md` and
  the Wave-A launch brief and `TASK-RD-00..17` split the next safe work into a 10.75–16 hour first
  offline wave and a 25.5–40 hour complete Engineer package. `TASK-AUD-07B` is strong-only. This is a
  frozen task proposal. The final unattended prompt selects C1/C2/C3 + RD-04/05/06/07/09/10/12,
  has explicit context-compaction/token rules, and received independent Reviewer APPROVE. It becomes
  implementation GO only when the owner pastes it into the new Goal session.
- **proxy note:** 3-parallel subagent spawns fail with proxy 400 `[1210]`; ≤2-parallel / single work.
  Future dispatch ≤2 concurrent.
- **do NOT:** run confirmatory/strategy/horizon/forward scripts; edit frozen prereg/ADR/config; infer
  B's paired differential CI; call historical cross-fit chronological OOS; inspect E3 outcome metrics;
  ignite E3 headline.
- **git:** branch `feat/e3-forward-ledger`; remote `main` includes `7dede9b`. Current uncommitted
  code includes approved C1/C2/C3 implementation/tests plus planning/state/task documentation; the
  Group A commit will use explicit file lists only.

## Overnight checkpoint (Wave-A)

- Goal: execute Wave-A C1/C2/C3 + RD-04/05/06/07/09/10/12 with independent gates and safe push. **COMPLETE.**
- All gates passed: C1/C2/C3 + RD-04/05/06/07/09/10/12 each have independent Verifier PASS + Reviewer APPROVE.
  Fixes applied and re-gated: RD-07 (generated_at caller-provided for byte-stability), RD-10 (vol_adj_mom
  last-12 window + std<=0), RD-12 (additive constituents_manifest_on + 3 unskipped manifest oracles;
  constituents_on behavior unchanged).
- Commits: `6085e92` Group A, `2653907` Group B, `5f884a3` Group C. Final docs/state bundle (this commit).
- Final gates: full hermetic pytest green (zero skips; only pre-existing forward_score warnings);
  `uv run --offline ruff check` clean; `git diff --check` clean; frozen/ledger/results/data/forward diff
  empty; no data/.env/*.parquet staged; no real network/LLM/research/forward script ran; E3 outcome unobserved.
- Files: RD-01/02/03/08/11/13..17 task specs remain PLANNED (future waves) — committed as planning docs.
- Blockers: none. Next: optional fast-forward push HEAD:main (origin/main is ancestor of HEAD).

## Wave-B checkpoint (2026-08-01, in progress)

- **Launch authorization:** owner `/goal` — "启用更多 agents 根据优先等级在不影响各自进程的前提下各自推进".
  Treated as owner authorization for the priority (P0→P1) offline RD program (the safe sonnet-tier set).
  Per-task authorization is recorded in each task file's 状态 line by the Orchestrator as the audit trail.
- **COMPLETE so far** (each: Engineer → independent Verifier PASS → independent Reviewer APPROVE → atomic
  commit; offline/hermetic; `runs/ledger.jsonl` untouched; no frozen surface touched):
  - RD-02 validation manifest — `97e5688`
  - RD-01 task-contract linter — `feb80ba` (first attempt lost to the parallel-writer race below; redone serially)
  - RD-13 cross-sectional variation guard — `2f0efd0`
- **KEY OPERATIONAL FINDING (binding):** spawning ≥2 writer subagents concurrently in the SHARED working tree
  loses one agent's untracked deliverables (RD-01 first attempt: `.pyc` survived in gitignored `__pycache__`,
  `.py` + README diff gone — consistent with a `git clean -fd`/`restore` across parallel-agent boundaries).
  **Writers are now SERIALIZED: exactly ONE Engineer subagent per message.** Parallel is reserved for read-only
  preflights only. See memory `aionis-parallel-writer-race`.
- **Model routing (binding):** only `sonnet`/`haiku` subagent aliases resolve to subagent-safe IDs; `opus`/`fable`
  resolve to `[1M]`-suffixed IDs and are DENIED by the enforcer. The RD program is sonnet-tier so this is fine.
  `TASK-AUD-07B` (strong-only, STATISTICAL HOLD) and `RD-15` (strong precondition) are DEFERRED until opus
  routing is fixed (drop `[1M]` suffix from `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_OPUS_MODEL`).
- **Authorization bookkeeping:** the first RD-02 Reviewer returned BLOCKED solely because the task file still said
  "PLANNED — not implementation-authorized"; resolved by recording the /goal authorization in the task 状态 line.
  All subsequently launched RD tasks are pre-authorized in their task files before dispatch.
- **Remaining safe queue (P1, sonnet-tier):** RD-17 (trial-intent registry) → RD-16 (eval uncertainty) → RD-11
  (provider replay) → RD-03 (chronological oracle, unlocked by RD-02 APPROVE) → RD-14 (reproducibility capsule,
  unlocked by RD-02 APPROVE). RD-08 remains HOLD (needs a strong-Researcher-frozen rule table first). RD-15 deferred (strong).
- **Verification status:** per-task pytest + ruff green; ledger empty diff across all Wave-B commits; no frozen
  prereg/ADR/config/result/data/forward surface touched; no real network/LLM/trial ran. The full hermetic suite
  has NOT been re-run this wave yet (defer to a pre-push gate).
- **Git:** branch `feat/e3-forward-ledger` ahead of origin by 8 (Wave-A + Wave-B). Not pushed (owner's call).
- **Do NOT:** run confirmatory/strategy/horizon/forward scripts; edit frozen prereg/ADR/config; observe E3
  outcome; spawn >1 writer subagent per message.

## Wave-B FINAL (2026-08-01, COMPLETE)

All 8 safe sonnet-tier RD tasks implemented, each with independent Verifier PASS + Reviewer APPROVE and an
atomic commit; offline/hermetic throughout:
- RD-02 validation manifest — `97e5688`
- RD-01 task-contract linter — `feb80ba` (first attempt lost to the parallel-writer race; redone serially)
- RD-13 cross-sectional variation guard — `2f0efd0`
- RD-17 trial-intent registry (HIGH-risk; ledger-bypass cleared) — `5dfe849`
- RD-16 eval uncertainty (Wilson≠Wald; seed=0 stratified bootstrap) — `ee223ae`
- RD-11 provider replay (salvaged a cut-off partial; audited + completed; providers/llm_client 0 diff) — `8a46179`
- RD-03 chronological oracle (HIGH-risk; cv.py 0 diff; lookahead rejected; real purgedcv) — `af7d673`
- RD-14 reproducibility capsule (outcome-free; deterministic capsule_id; atomic write + refuse-overwrite) — `f397383`

Final pre-push verification: full hermetic pytest GREEN (zero failures/skips; only the pre-existing
forward-score UserWarnings documented in Wave-A); `uv run --offline ruff check` clean; `runs/ledger.jsonl`
0 diff across the whole wave; frozen-surface audit (docs/phase-*, decisions/, runs/ledger, config/, data/,
*.parquet, pyproject.toml, uv.lock) — NONE touched; no real network/LLM/trial/forward script ran; E3 outcome
unobserved.

Process notes (binding for future waves):
- Writers are SERIALIZED (exactly one Engineer subagent per message) — parallel writers in the shared tree
  lost untracked deliverables (see memory aionis-parallel-writer-race).
- Only `sonnet`/`haiku` subagent aliases are dispatchable; `opus`/`fable` resolve to `[1M]` IDs and are
  denied by the enforcer → `TASK-AUD-07B` (strong-only) + `RD-15` (strong precondition) are DEFERRED until
  opus routing is fixed.
- The `[1210]` proxy "API parameter" error is transient on Reviewer spawns — a single retry has succeeded
  every time; it is NOT the 5-hour usage cap.
- Owner authorization for the priority RD program was the `/goal` directive; recorded per-task in each task
  file's 状态 line. (The first RD-02 Reviewer BLOCKed on the stale "PLANNED — not implementation-authorized"
  status, which is why all later tasks were pre-authorized in their task files before dispatch.)
- Per the owner: do not spend tokens checking whether the 5-hour usage cap has reset — if the session is
  running, it is reset (see memory aionis-no-rate-limit-check).

Remaining (NOT started — legitimately blocked, not merely unauthorized):
- RD-08 HOLD — needs a strong-Researcher-frozen zero-LLM rule table before low-reasoning implementation.
- RD-15 DEFERRED — rank-objective contract is a strong-model decision precondition (lambdarank vs rank_xendcg,
  monthly relevance binning, ties, missing, group=query-month); also needs opus routing.
- AUD-07B — STATISTICAL HOLD on ADR-010 TOST p-value direction / sequential-equivalence construction; strong-only.
- RES-02/03/08/10 — HOLD/replan per roadmap; their foundations (RD-13 done; RD-15/RD-08 still pending) must
  precede them.

Git: branch `feat/e3-forward-ledger` ahead of origin by 13 (Wave-A + Wave-B). Not pushed — owner's call.
Safe RD queue now exhausted for the sonnet tier.
